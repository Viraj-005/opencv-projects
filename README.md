## **📂 Projects Included**  

✅ **1. Motion Filtering on a Video** 🎥  
   - This project applies **filtering techniques** to track and enhance motion in a video.  
   - Techniques used: Background subtraction, Gaussian blur.  

✅ **2. Edge Detection** ✨  
   - Detect object boundaries in images.  
   - Uses algorithms like **Canny** and **Sobel** edge detection.  

✅ **3. Making Text Images Readable Again** 🔎  
   - Enhance low-quality or blurred text images.  
   - Uses **thresholding, sharpening, and noise reduction**.  

✅ **4. Extract Text from Images (OCR)** 📝  
   - Use **Tesseract OCR** to extract text from images.  
   - Works with scanned documents and handwritten text.  

✅ **5. Color Detector** 🎨  
   - Detect and highlight specific colors in an image.  
   - Uses **HSV color space** for color recognition.
