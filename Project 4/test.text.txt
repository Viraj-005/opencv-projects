When developing a product, service, or customer experience, using an Agile
methodology, we usually start with building minimum viable product (MVP).

An MVP is a partially-developed version of a new product that allows a team to
quickly collect maximum information from users with the least effort and
investment. This MVP is not the final product; rather, it's a baseline that reflects the
core functionality, enabling us to learn from user interactions and feedback.

With Agile, we can develop a new product in both an iterative and incremental
process. Understanding the distinction between these two development methods
is crucial as it allows teams to align their project strategy with business goals,
market needs, and user expectations.

To better understand these concepts, let's look at the following examples of how an
app would be developed using both iterative and incremental development methods.
